# Temp3113

I'm **Andrea** Edwards (@aedwardsxula).  The flyer mentions _mobile app development_ and _Oracle Cloud_ so I'll ask the guest speaker: (a) what are mobile apps and (b) what is Oracle Cloud.

I'm **Tia** Bishop (@tbishop25). My two questions for the speaker are (1) what languages/frameworks does Oracle use for mobile development and (2) how can students use Oracle Cloud.
