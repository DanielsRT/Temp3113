I'm **Andrea** Edwards (@aedwardsxula).  The flyer mentions _mobile app development_ and _Oracle Cloud_ so I'll ask the guest speaker: (a) what are mobile apps and (b) what is Oracle Cloud.

I'm **Blue** Bishop (@tbishop25). My two questions for the speaker are (1) what languages/frameworks does Oracle use for mobile development and (2) how can students use Oracle Cloud. Tia is cool! - Darryl :)
 
I'm **Purple** Terrell jr. (@darryl-ty). I would like to ask the speaker (a)Will students have an extended free trial period or free version of Oracle cloud to use and experiment with? (b) Are there any security testing features or applications within Oracle Cloud?

My view of the Oracle presentation last Thursday - I believe that Mr. Ram's presentation of Oracle Cloud was phenomenal, hoever, I would have loved to hear more about the different security measures they have in place to secure their customers in the cloud. Security will definitely play an important role as we advance in technology.

I'm **Robert** (@DanielsRT). I'll ask the speaker: (a) Does Oracle use in-house hardware to host cloud services and (b) Does Oracle have any plans in investing in its own server-hosting hardware. Daniels - Crooms Academy of Information Technology.
My main critique of the Oracle presentation revolves around the two demos. Instead of just showing us how to set up two of the services, it would have been more useful if he had shown us an example of how they could be used. For example, instead of showing how to create a virtual machine, he could give an example of an Oracle-hosted virtual machine running some basic application.
