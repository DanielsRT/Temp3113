# Temp3113

I'm **Andrea** Edwards (@aedwardsxula).  The flyer mentions _mobile app development_ and _Oracle Cloud_ so I'll ask the guest speaker: (a) what are mobile apps and (b) what is Oracle Cloud.

I'm **Tia** Bishop (@tbishop25). My two questions for the speaker are (1) what languages/frameworks does Oracle use for mobile development and (2) how can students use Oracle Cloud. 

I'm **Darryl** Terrell jr. (@darryl-ty). I would like to ask the speaker (a)Will students have an extended free trial period or free version of Oracle cloud to use and experiment with? (b) Are there any security testing features or applications within Oracle Cloud?
